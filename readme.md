# Project Euler Solutions (for selected problems)

I am trying to keep a repo of project euler solutions. For now, all of it is done in python. 

I don't think I will solve everything. Some problems just seem too bruteforce-ish for me to actually learn anything. So I skip those.

That's not saying that any algorithms used here will be simple brute force algorithms.

I have tried my best to optimize everything with numba's excellent jit (and related) modules. It truly is magical.
